USER STORIES:
-------------
    A user story is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person 
who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system.
    These stories use non-technical language to provide context for the development team and their efforts. 
After reading a user story, the team knows why they are building, 
                                           what they're building, and
										   what value it creates. 

What Is a Good User Story?
-------------------------
    Agile user stories are composed of three aspects which are card, 
conversation, and confirmation:

Card: Written description of the story, used for planning and as a reminder
Conversation: Conversations about the story that serve to flesh out the details of the story
Confirmation: Tests that convey and document details that can be used to determine when a story is complete.

Why to create user stories?
-----------------------
Stories keep the focus on the user.
Stories enable collaboration.
Stories drive creative solutions.

How to write a Userstory?
As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason > --Standard Template

Example: Zomato application

**As a user, I want to be able to sign up for an account using my email and password
 so that I can access the platform's features and personalize my experience.
**As a user, I want to be able to reset my password if I forget it
 so that I can regain access to my account without assistance.
**As a restaurant owner, I want to be able to create and manage my restaurant profile, including adding menu items, 
 updating business hours, and responding to customer reviews, so that I can showcase my offerings effectively 
 and engage with potential customers.

 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
 ------------------
	In Agile, acceptance criteria refer to a set of predefined requirements that must be met to mark a user story complete. 
Acceptance criteria are also sometimes called the “definition of done” because they determine the scope and requirements 
that must be executed by developers to consider the user story finished.

How to write acceptance criteria?
--------------------------------
	There is a process in software engineering known as behavior-driven development. 
It describes a process that encourages communication and collaboration between business participants 
in a software project and the development team.

Two Common Formats: Scenario-oriented format
                    Rule oriented format
					
Scenario-oriented format:
-----------------------
	The scenario-oriented AC approach is inherited from behavior-driven development and is an excellent way 
to set guidelines on when developers should begin and end testing a certain feature. 

Scenario – In the first statement, you’ll have to write the name of the behavior that you’re describing.
Given – The second statement refers to the beginning stage of the scenario.
When – The third statement involves a particular action that you want the user to make.
Then – This is used to describe the outcome of the third statement.
And – You can use “And” to continue any statement except “Scenario.”
=====================================================================================
Example: Banking Application

User story: As a credit cardholder, I want to receive a notification for remaining balance 
            for every transaction so that i could not go to netbanking.
			
Scenario: Notification for the balance
Given: The user has opened a bank account
And: The user has received a credit card
When: The user has made a transaction
Then: The system notifies the user of their balance
========================================================================================
Rule oriented format:
The rule-oriented format is basically like writing a simple bullet list with all the features you want your product to have.
By doing this, you’ll ensure that the development team understands your vision clearly.
